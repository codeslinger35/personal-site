                    I am a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.tylertech.com" rel="external" target="_blank">Tyler Technologies</a>.
                    I work on the Enterprise ERP archticture team where I maintain mission critical software. My team writes code to benefit
                    customers, developers in our division, and internal integrations. We act as guidance for our division with technical support
                    and documentation. I mainly support our cloud release products utilizing AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and C#.

                    I worked as an intern at <a href="https://www.tylertech.com" rel="external" target="_blank">Tyler Technologies</a> from May 2019 to May 2023.
                    My responsibilities grew to being a top contributor on the companies largest projects. I take part in
                    learning new technologies, implementing new tech stacks, and designing applications. I helped train
                    newer employees and lead team wide training sessions for the technologies I implemented. My biggest projects included
                    full-stack rewrites of enterprise web applications that involved overhauling the UI in Angular 12 and porting the
                    backend logic to Genero RESTful APIs. Next time you are at your local city hall, ask them what software they use -
                    I might've squashed bugs in it.

                I have been on skates since I was 2 and playing hockey not long after that. I spent lots of weekends in rinks
                trying to make it big - this website's existence tells you all you need to know about how that went. I am still
                passionate about the game and play men's league wherever I can. I served as president of RIT's roller hockey
                team for 2 years where we competed in the ECRHA (<a href="https://ritroller.com" rel="external" target="_blank">check it out</a>).
                By the way, I'm a Bruins fan, hope that's not a dealbreaker.
